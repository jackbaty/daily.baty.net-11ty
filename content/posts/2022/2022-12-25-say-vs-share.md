I've maintained a "daily notes" blog in [one form](https://wiki.baty.net/#Journal) or [another](https://daily.baty.net) for years. The current iteration is at [baty.blog](https://baty.blog) and is managed using [Tinderbox](http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/). It's like an online journal. It's a pleasure to write in, and for me, a pleasure to read.

But sometimes I wonder whether I _need_ a second blog for short, "micro" posts. I could instead put them here at baty.net, but I've never been able to wrangle WordPress into doing that properly. Or perhaps they could go on the wonderful [micro.blog](https://micro.blog), Tumblr, or even Mastodon.

A few days ago I decided to try using a self-hosted Mastodon (actually GoToSocial) instance for short, frequent daily posts. That's what it's for, right? I installed GoToSocial on one of my servers and began posting. I immediately didn't like it. The feed on my one-person instance is mostly empty but feels like it shouldn't be. It's hard to explain, but it felt wrong somehow. It felt like a social network comprised of one individual. Also, it looks horrible.

What about my usual Mastodon account at [fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/@jackbaty)? Why not post there? The timeline is busy and I don't even have to bother maintaining anything. Fosstodon doesn't work because it's not mine. I want the sort of stuff I'm writing on my daily blog to be entirely under my control.

All of this reminded me that there's a difference between the things I want to say and the things I want to _share_. There's a lot of overlap, but the distinction is important. There are things I want to say out loud, but not necessarily to a room full of people. I don't mind if someone reads them, but I don't want to force them into anyone's social feeds. If someone wants to read them via RSS, of course, that's cool. I prefer that most of what I post be read via pull rather than push, if you know what I mean.

So I guess for now I'll continue to post the things I want to _say_, to [baty.blog](https://baty.blog). The things I want to _share_ will go to [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@jackbaty). Some will go both places. I hope that's OK.
