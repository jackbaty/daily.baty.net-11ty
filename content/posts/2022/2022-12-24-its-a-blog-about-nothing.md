I just wanted to say that I love having a blog. I love having a place to write where I don't have to be precise, polished, or even complete. I don't have to stay in my lane. I can write about whatever I'm thinking about, in whatever way I choose. It doesn't matter what that is.

I hope people are able to find a little value in it, but it's OK if they don't.
