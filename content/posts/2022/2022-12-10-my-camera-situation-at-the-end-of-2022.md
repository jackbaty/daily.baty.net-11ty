Everything changes all the time.

2022 has been another year of wildly rearranging my approach to photography. I've gone all-in Leica and back. I've been all-in with film, and back. And so on. I do this because I'm more of a camera nerd than an artist.

Let's start with the film cameras. First, I sold the big Linhof Master Technika. It was a beautiful kit, but I almost never used it. I still have an old Crown Graphic for when I get the urge to shoot 4x5.

I still have three Leica M film cameras: M3, M6, and MP. I tried and failed at selling the M6. Here they are on my workbench:

Leicas: M3, MP, and M6

The M6 is for sale again. I will hate myself for selling it, but it's dumb to have something so nice (and valuable) just sitting on a shelf most of the time.

I was also able to revive the Ricoh GR1, which I'm very happy about.

Ricoh GR1, back from the dead.

So, what about digital, then? That's still being tweaked, but right now I'm going with the new X-T5 and a few favorite lenses.

Testing the X-T5

I ordered the X-T5 with the 16-80 "kit" lens. I don't like zooms, and I don't love f4 lenses, but it's a nice all-arounder in a pinch and a cheap way to get it. I have the 23 f2, 35 f1.4, and 56 1.2 on the way.

I've stopped scanning film with a digital camera, so I shouldn't miss the Lumix S5 and Macro, which I've traded for the Fuji lenses. I can change my mind pretty inexpensively with the Fuji 60mm macro any time.

I have come _very_ close to buying another Leica M10-R, but I'm going to see how it feels to use the Fuji for digital.

Where does that leave us? To sum up:

**Every Day(ish) Carry:**

- Leica MP

- Ricoh GR1

- Fujifilm X-T5

**Change-of-Pace Carry:**

- Leica M3

- Hasselblad 500C/M

- Crown Graphic 4x5

- Assorted 35mm (OM-1n, Leica IIIf, etc)
