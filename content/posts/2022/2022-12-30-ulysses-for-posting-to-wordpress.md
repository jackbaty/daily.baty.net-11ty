[Ulysses](https://ulysses.app/) is a nice app, but it's been a while since I've used it regularly. We never really clicked. There's something about the editor and its variation of Markdown that felt off, somehow. What I've wished for was iA Writer's editor attached to Ulysses' library.

I enjoy checking it new features in Ulysses when updates are released. My license is part of the [SetApp](https://setapp.com/) subscription so there's no cost for keeping Ulysses around.

One of the things bringing me back to Ulysses today is the new Projects features. It's like "hoisting" in a decent outliner. Or narrowing a buffer in Emacs. I like the focus it promises.

But the reason I'm typing this in Ulysses today is that I kind of hate writing in the WordPress editor. Gutenberg has come a long way, and is very powerful, but it's still annoying for actually writing. If I want to drop in and resize an image or include a quote with citation, Gutenberg is great. If I simply want to lay down some text, it sucks. Whatever nits I have to pick with Ulysses' editor are meaningless compared to the annoyances I have with WordPress. So here we are.

Other than the editor, I'm still happy with my recent switch to WordPress. If I can find a pleasant way to write for WordPress, I may stick with it.
