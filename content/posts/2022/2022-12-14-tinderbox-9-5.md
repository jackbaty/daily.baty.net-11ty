Eastgate has released a [nice update to Tinderbox](https://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/updates/Tinderbox95.html). Version 9.5 has some nifty features:

**Automatically add a Prototype or Place when adding notes**. Naming a note something like "John Smith#Person" will create the note titled John Smith and automatically apply the "Person" prototype. I use a lot of prototypes so this is handy

**Geographic Adornments.** "If any adornment has an Address, Tinderbox will figure out the corresponding latitude and longitude and display a map of the region."

**Preview and Export:** Sensible default templates and prototypes have been added and are configured automatically. Tinderbox's export features are deep and powerful, but can be tricky to grasp. This helps get things rolling.

**View and edit multiple notes.** This is great! Select a bunch of notes and then read and edit them together as one document, but they remain separate notes also.

Another useful update to one of my all-time favorite apps.
