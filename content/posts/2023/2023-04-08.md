I missed posting yesterday because I became convinced that I wanted to move [baty.net](https://baty.net) over to Blot, [like this](https://jackbaty.blot.im). After several hours of catching up by migrating posts from late 2022, I was into January 2023's posts when I ran out of steam and started wondering why I was doing it in the first place. Typical me, right? I'll probably finish migrating content today, then decide if I want to actually replace baty.net again. I swore I wouldn't. Again.

Baty.net: [Blot is just right](https://baty.net/2023/blot-is-just-right). (I told you!)
