Some days I wonder if I'm reaching that age where the world is moving faster than I am willing to travel. How long before I don't have the energy to keep up?

I also wonder if I should become more like everyone else. Should I post "5 Tips to improve your workflow right now!" articles on Medium? Should I be "super excited" to humblebrag about myself on LinkedIn? Should I fire up my Instagram account and splash gaudy "stories" all over it throughout the day? Should I buy some neon background lights and work on an unnecessary 90-second musical intro to my upstart YouTube channel? No, I shouldn't.
