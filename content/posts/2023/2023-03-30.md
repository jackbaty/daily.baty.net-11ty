I'm so tempted to post things here rather than WordPress, but I'm not going to because that tugs on too many threads and threatens to unravel the whole thing.

What's a good way to add revenue without looking like a schmuck who only cares about the money?

Is it weird that I add to these daily posts from the top down? It feels right to me: here's today, read it! but I wonder if it feels backwards, since each paragraph is really a separate "post".
