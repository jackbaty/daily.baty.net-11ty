I am politically withdrawn lately. I don't see that changing. It's probably due to watching news, which I try avoiding but sometimes don't. Or maybe it's that so many completely horrible people are getting their way...and that so many others approve of it. Anyway, "Better to be sane than informed".

"Double wristing" watches has been fun; the Apple Watch on the left wrist and one of my "real" watches on my right. (I'm left handed). This gave me the fitness and sleep tracking benefits of the Apple Watch, while also letting me enjoy wearing one of my fun or nice watches. The problem is that I still sometimes hesitate which wrist to look at for the time. I keep the Apple Watch on theatre mode so it's not meant as a watch, but I still try to glance to see the weather too often. This just adds confusion and friction, so I'm back to just one watch at a time.

Those complaining about AI search results being sometimes wrong must not have done a Google search in a while.

Let's all agree to stop saying "This is the way" from now on.

I don't need another Leica body, but this makes me want one anyway:

                      Technicians give each model over 16 hours of individual attention, crafting the instrument from more than 1,100 parts, rigorously testing it and fine-tuning any adjustments before shipping it to Wetzlar.

Do you think I could come up with any more ways to quote things within a single post? :).
