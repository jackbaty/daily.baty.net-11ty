I'm always over-complicating things by trying to make them simpler.

"WordPress. Farm tractor of the internet" [@danilo](https://hachyderm.io/@danilo/110104318183642855). That's a pretty good analogy. What I want for my blog, then, is an electric bicycle. No one makes one of those.

Today I learned about [Eleventy Starter Ghost](https://github.com/TryGhost/eleventy-starter-ghost) which is an Eleventy starter website that uses Ghost as a headless CMS. That seems worth investigating.

The next big set of opportunities for most people isn't creating new tools for AI. The opportunity lies right next to that, though. But where?
