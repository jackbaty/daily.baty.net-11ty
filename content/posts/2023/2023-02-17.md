I'm thinking about the Leica SL2 again. My new Fuji X-T5 is a fine camera, and more than enough for me, but it doesn't give me The Feels the way the Leica did. I'm as much a fan of cameras as I am of photography, so the camera matters. Plus, I'm a little ashamed to admit that the crop factor bugs me a little.

I'm going to start calling my box of paper notes a "note box". Clever, eh? "Zettelkasten" holds a bit too much pretension, and "Antinet" is just a made up word that turned into a book. I'll go with note box.

It's pathetic how I feel the need to ask some online community or another where I should file my latest index card.

I'm "rendered on the server" years old.
