To no one's surpise, I've found that I don't enjoy posting my daily notes over in WordPress at baty.net. What should I do about that? My choices is between Eleventy (using Emacs) and Tinderbox. My head says to use Eleventy since I already live in Emacs so it's /right there/. But my heart belongs to Tinderbox. It's a dilemma!
