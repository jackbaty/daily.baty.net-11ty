Refusing a phone call because, "It's so rude!" is a lame cover for selfishness. Answer the damn phone, ya princess.

I don't receive many blog comments, but still I worry about what happens when spammers start using AI to generate real-sounding comments so that I waste time responding to them, like an idiot.

I'm pretty sure that the right answer for my ongoing static blogging needs is [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) rather than [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). Hugo is great, but I'm never going to learn Go, and if I must learn a templating language, it should be one that's more broadly applicable, such as Liquid and Nunjucks. Also, the more exposed I am to everyday JavaScript, the more likely I am to stop avoiding it.
