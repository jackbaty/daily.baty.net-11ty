My biggest (and only) issue with the [Pilot Custom 823 fountain pen](https://baty.net/2021/pilot-custom-823-fountain-pen) is that it takes too long to run out of ink and I get bored using the same color for so long.

Cool, [Khoi's January 2023 movie summary](https://www.subtraction.com/2023/02/13/movies-watched-january-2023/) is out. He did better this month, except that "Fletch" (1985) > "Tár" (2022). Fight me.
