I'm experimenting with using [Tempel](https://github.com/minad/tempel) rather than yasnippet for expansion in Emacs.

I'm also considering a move back to using Eleventy (or, gasp!, Hugo) for publishing this blog. I want to write everything in Emacs. If only there were an ox-11ty package for Emacs so I could compose using Org-mode and have it kick out Eleventy-compatible markdown files.

And to think, yesterday I almost quit Emacs again.
