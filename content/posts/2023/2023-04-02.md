An email from LinkedIn. Subject: "People in the United States follow these creators." jfc.

I'm still wildly happy with Org-mode, but I'm noticing another bout of Text File Fatigue coming on. I may try riding this one out instead of changing everything for a week. [The wiki](https://wiki.baty.net) may see a little love, though.

All the 'splaining in the world that ChatGPT isn't actually "intelligent" it's nothing more than a predictive text engine forming "statistical associations between terms" is just shouting into the wind. Normal people will simply continue using the tool for all sorts of things, for better or worse. They don't give a shit about the "how".
