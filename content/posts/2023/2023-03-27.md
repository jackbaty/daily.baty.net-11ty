[mu/Mu4e](https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/) 1.10 was [recently released](https://github.com/djcb/mu/blob/release/1.10/NEWS.org) and it has some nice updates. Of course it's broken in Doom Emacs. This happens every time. I've worked around the issues by disabling `evil-collection`. I do wonder if dealing with all this in Emacs is the best use of my time. I spend _hours_each week futzing with Emacs, and not all of it is just for fun. 

I'm typing this in NeoVim because I don't have enough problems with my process right now.
