{% sideImage "/img/small/sunrise.jpg", "Sunrise" %}

I've started reading "[Engineering Management for the Rest of Us](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BHX6NLGZ)" by Sara Drasner. Maybe it'll kickstart my brain for the upcoming job search.

I've added a custom shortcode for `sideImage`. It's a simple way to include small, right-aligned images using shorthand.

Having this site built/hosted on Netlify makes me think too much about "build minutes". I only get 300/month but "only" is probably the wrong word. So far I've only used one minute, so I doubt this will become a problem. But still, should I wait to deploy this update or not? I don't like worrying about it.

I feel like most of us have honed our bullshit detectors pretty well over the past decade of using Google for searches. This skill should be adaptable for AI responses as well, no?

My Mastodon timeline is starting to feel more like Twitter every day. I don't know what's causing it. Boosts, mostly. "Hide boosts from *" I guess.
