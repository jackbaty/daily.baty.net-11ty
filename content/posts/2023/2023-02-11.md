I gravitate toward the obscure option and sometimes suffer for it. Why can't I just go along and use the popular things?

This quote is a few years old, but applies to the current AI discussions:

Do you know what I miss? I miss when [Roam](https://roamresearch.com) was the hot (and only) new thing and it worked and it did everything I (thought) needed. I lived happily in the Daily Notes page in a browser and life was simple and good. Options are bad for me.
