I'm trying to sync my Doom emacs install this morning and seeing errors that the scripts can't resolve git.savannah.gnu.org so nothing works. I don't like when the app I live in breaks.

While looking at the GoAccess logs for this site, that there were a lot of 404s for the old RSS feeds at index.xml and allposts.xml. I've added redirects in the Caddyfile to the new URL at /feed/feed.xml. You'll be seeing some RSS noise if you were subscribed using the old URLs, sorry.
