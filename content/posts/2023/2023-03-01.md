It's as if I am incapable of learning. I've been enjoying Drummer again for my daily blogging. It does nearly everything right. And then today, Dave [wrote](http://scripting.com/2023/03/01.html#a140916): "Something changed over here, and I'm more inclined to let you all take care of yourselves for a while." I hope he's OK and takes care of himself. We've all got to do that first. But this kind of thing never bodes well when the sole developer of a tool I'd like to rely on decides to maybe not care about the users "for a while".
