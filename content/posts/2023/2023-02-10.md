Our internet was out when I woke up this morning. I got all excited while walking the dog, thinking about all the things I might accomplish today without any online distractions. It was fixed by the time we got back, so Hi! ðŸ‘‹.

It is astonishing to me how many people are so quick to dismiss AI Chatbots like ChatGPT because they "...don't answer every question perfectly right now!" (paraphrasing).

If I decide to dive into JavaScript, I will do so without even _looking_ at frameworks or libraries. That can come later...if at all.

Checking in on my seldom-used Roam database, I see that nearly all of the sites I had linked to in my "Daily Haunts" page are either gone or haven't been updated in months. "Haunts", used another way, might still be the right word for the place. ðŸ˜¥
