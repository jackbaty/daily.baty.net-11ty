It seems as if everyone is either wildly desperate for AI to succeed or absolutely convinced it will fail. I don't understand why more people aren't simply curious and following along.

If a company decides that it prefers to have people come into the office to do some or most of their work, that is a reasonable decision to make. If, as a result, quality people don't want to work there, that is also a reasonable decision. We keep pretending that one or the other is correct for all cases and that's simply not true. We act as if every person can handle remote work. Or that they can't. It depends, right?

While many wring their hands and whine about the failures of AI, millions are using it every day to do all sorts of useful, real-world tasks. They're just doing it instead of over-thinking it. I find myself in both camps.
