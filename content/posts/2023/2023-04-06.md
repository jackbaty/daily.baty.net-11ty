FYI I use ChatGPT every day. I just don't share every single conversation I have with it.

This is still happening:
> 6:00am: “Plain text is The Way!”  
> 7:30am: “Plain text is unnecessarily limiting and living there is wasted opportunity!”  
> 5:00pm: “It happened again today, didn’t it?”
> 
> <cite>Me, one year ago</cite>

OK so I don't think I can continue to stomach using WordPress. What I want is a simple way to post content to a blog, but I want to use Markdown. I want it to be like Blot. Hmmm.
