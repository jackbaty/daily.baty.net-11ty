[Wavelength](https://www.wavelength.app/) needs a little work. I can't select text using the mouse on my Mac. I really need to search for messages. And I want emoji reactions to messages. Also, many of the groups I'm in tend to just reuse one or two threads, which kind of defeats the purpose. I have that in Signal already. It's a nice app, and it's early, but I'm eager to see improvements.
