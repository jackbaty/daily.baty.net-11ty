[Wavelength](https://www.wavelength.app/) needs a little work. I can't select text using the mouse on my Mac. I really need to search for messages. And I want emoji reactions to messages. Also, many of the groups I'm in tend to just reuse one or two threads, which kind of defeats the purpose. I have that in Signal already. It's a nice app, and it's early, but I'm eager to see improvements.

I wrote, in [Back to Org-Roam](https://baty.net/2023/back-to-org-roam), "Since moving this file into Org-roam, I’ve turned each book’s heading into its own node, making it easier to search for a book or to link between the book and its author note or a concept note". I've not used this a single time since then, and probably won't. Once again, "but what if?!" guides my hand and adds nothing.
