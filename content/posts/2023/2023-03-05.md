I've been [tracking an issue](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/issues/2198) with the way backlinks are displayed that affects my use of Org-roam. Someone finally discovered a workaround when using Doom Emacs: delete the compiled version of org-roam-utils. Like this:

`rm .config/emacs/.local/straight/build-*/org-roam/org-roam-utils.elc`

Now my links show up correctly. Finally!
