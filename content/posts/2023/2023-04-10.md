I brought the SL2 to my parents' house yesterday so I could document our Easter celebration. I took six photos. All of them were taken from the chair I was already sitting in. None were good. It seems I can't even be bothered to get out of my chair in order to take a photo.

Sold the Fujifilm 56mm f1.4 lens this morning. I'll miss that one, but with no Fuji cameras around it's not much use :).

> Of course, none of this means that these LLMs and similar probabilistic AI-like models can’t do cool shit. They can do very cool shit, and I’ve never said otherwise. What we might want to ask is why so many people are so invested in believing that they can do more than cool shit.
