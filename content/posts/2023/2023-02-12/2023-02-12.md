It's like I'm a different person every day. Yesterday I was myself from some alternate universe in which I use Roam for writing notes and BBEdit for everything else. I like that universe, but then this morning I fired up Emacs and started typing this like nothing yesterday even happened.

Normal people don't spend time worrying about where they write things down, right? I think about it at least 20% of my waking hours&mdash;some days much more&mdash;and I don't even _need_ to take careful notes. I just like notes.

At times, it seems like everything I own is aspirational.

Speaking of aspirational, being unfashionable is a new goal of mine

Today, [thanks to BSAG](https://www.rousette.org.uk/archives/neovim-again/), I learned about two cool new things: [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) and [Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit). After an hour with LazyVim I'm sold enough to run with it for a while.
