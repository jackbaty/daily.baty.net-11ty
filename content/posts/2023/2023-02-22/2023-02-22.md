Some days I just don't feel like it, you know?

I'm [once again](https://baty.net/2022/moving-my-journal-to-digital) thinking about moving more of my journaling to digital. As much as I love pen and paper, it becomes tiresome. I write too slowly and to sloppily. I suppose the idea is that it gets me away from the computer, but I'm hardly ever away from the computer, so that turns out to be mostly aspirational.

For some reason, I'm working on a new site build using [Eleventy](https://11y.dev) for [baty.net](https://baty.net/2022/moving-my-journal-to-digital). My usual and regular frustration with using WordPress is kicking in and I need something fresh (that's not Hugo or Ghost).

My brief foray back into Fuji-land cost me more than I care to admit. I've sold the Fuji X-T5 kit that I purchased only two months ago. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
