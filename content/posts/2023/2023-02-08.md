I haven't made any changes to the Eleventy parts here in a whole day. That's gotta be a good sign. Update, ten minutes later: I removed tags from the Archives listing because I don't feel like worrying about tagging.

Spent an hour this morning "installing" notes into my Antinet. It all still feels a bit haphazard, but maintaining a good index should help. It's a little disappointing how many "main cards" I wrote after reviewing so many bibliography cards. I suppose that's part of the idea. I'm not supposed to be simply hoarding information.
