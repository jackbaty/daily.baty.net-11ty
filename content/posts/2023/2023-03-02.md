I'm thinking I should work on optimizing my Emacs/Eleventy blog tooling rather than spreading things too thin with things like Drummer. Dave's recent pull back has made me realize I want to be in control of my entire publishing pipeline. Relying on someone else to support me is risky.

Speaking of optimizing, I've removed the dark version of the CSS from this site. I don't like how it looks in dark mode so you don't get to see it in dark mode, sorry.

[baty.net](https://baty.net) is back on WordPress and I don't want to talk about it.
