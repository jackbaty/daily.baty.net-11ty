I'm having second thoughts about rebuilding this blog in Hugo for use at Baty.net. There is an index card pinned to the board in my office that reads, "Use what you have!". I should heed that advice. If I want baty.net to be a static blog, I could easily just start posting everything here using Eleventy and move the domain to baty.net instead. Done and done, right? On the other hand, I could keep doing what I'm already doing and not have to worry about any of it. This morning, that sounds about right.

I miss Twitter. Old Twitter, anyway.

I don't need to hang out with "like-minded" people, but I do prefer to be around people with interests similar to mine.
