Some days I wonder if I wouldn't be better off using Hugo for this blog. Today is one of those days, because I'm _also_ considering moving baty.net back to an SSG because my dislike of WordPress grows each day I use it.

I'm giving [Mullvad VPN](https://mullvad.net/en/) a go.

I haven't written anything in my paper notebook in a week. I wonder what's up with that.
