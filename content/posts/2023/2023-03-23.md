I'm in that mode where any time I have to type more than a few words outside of Emacs I get annoyed. This is especially true when that "outside" is WordPress. Blech. 

One concern I have with using Tinderbox for blogging is that export times are already becoming noticeably longer. Not long, yet, just longer. Posting several times each day is adding up quickly. I'm always tweaking, too, so any delays can quickly become annoying. Something to keep an eye on.
