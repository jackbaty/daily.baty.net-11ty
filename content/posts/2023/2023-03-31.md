I may just give up on managing my email in Emacs. I've spent way too much time recently futzing with it, and I don't receive nearly enough email to justify the effort. It's fun, and makes me feel just that much cooler, but I should be focusing on other things. It doesn't help that I love both Mu4e and Notmuch equally, which sends me into my usual, unproductive, circular paths.

Why do you suppose I've not been taking photographs lately? It's certainly not for lack of cameras. I just don't feel like it. It's boring all of a sudden. Maybe it's not that it's boring, but that I am simply uninspired. I'm packing up the stuff in my basement "studio" today because I haven't touched any of it in weeks, and it's in the way. Since when is photo gear "clutter"? I'll come around, but maybe I need time doing something else.

I'm having one of those days where I don't feel like it, ya know? I don't feel like dealing with why Org files won't pre-indent like they're supposed to. I don't feel like dealing with Mu4e problems with evil-collection. I don't feel like deciding whether a headline belongs on its own in Org-roam. I don't feel like choosing between Mu4e and notmuch. I don't feel like any of it.
