I'm telling you, using the WordPress editor is the most frustrating experience. After selecting text, I often can't cut or delete it. Today, it became a game of whack-a-mole while trying to add a quotation with citation. The quoted portion kept reverting to a normal paragraph. I ended up with two quotation blocks, but when I deleted the empty one it also deleted the other one with it. I'm about ready to pitch the whole thing.
