Yesterday I typed everything on an Apple Wireless keyboard into iA Writer. I enjoyed the second part of that experience. This morning, I'm back in Emacs on the HHKB. It's worth sacrificing my pinky in order to use the HHKB and Emacs is so damned good at so many things. Good morning!

I feel like the sea change that is generative AI is passing me by.

Obsidian, I must admit, is fun to play with.

I think I want a job. I opened LinkedIn and started scrolling. In less than 30 seconds I was so disenchanted with modern "networking" that I shut down the entire computer and took a nap.
