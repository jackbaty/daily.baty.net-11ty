I haven't been shooting much film recently. Hell, I haven't been shooting much of _anything_.

I thought I wanted to build a Hugo blog from scratch. No template, theme, or anything. That was a terrible idea. I'm much better suited to modifying something that already exists.

Ordered Tim (Wait But Why) Urban's new book, "[What's Our Problem?](https://waitbutwhy.com/)". I'm looking forward to this one!
