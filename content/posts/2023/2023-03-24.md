I'm afraid I've done it again. I'm back to <mark>posting daily notes here at daily.baty.net</mark> _and_ it's back to using Eleventy. I prefer writing in Emacs and detest writing in WordPress, so I'm afraid that both WordPress and Tinderbox are sidelined as my daily notes engines for the moment. I added some context on baty.net: [Journal posts are back on daily.baty.net](https://baty.net/2023/journal-posts-are-back-on-daily-baty-net).

It's going to be interesting to watch how ongoing <mark>changes in AI models</mark> affect the burgeoning "prompt writers" industry. Will it be similar to how everyone flips out when Google changes their search or YouTube algorithm today?
