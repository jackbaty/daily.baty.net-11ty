I’m exhausted. I think it’s because I haven’t been working in more than a month and my brain has had too much free time to “figure stuff out.” (Yes, I know how it sounds to complain about exhaustion while not having a job!)

As an experiment, I’m going to live the month of May in “Easy Mode”. This means I’m going to solve problems with quick, obvious, _easy_ solutions. I’m going to use the easy-to-use tools. And I’m going to make various processes as easy as possible.

Examples? Sure!

- Roam not Emacs
- Lightroom CC not Photo Mechanic and Capture One
- Things not Org mode
- Day One not Org Journal
- WordPress not Hugo
- Streaming music not FLAC/MP3 files
- Netflix not Plex
- Books not Kindle
- Walks not Workouts
- Mac not Linux

It could be argued that some of these are backwards, but this is where I’m starting, and the gist is: nothing fancy for a while.
