# What I'm doing Now

What I’m doing as of **February 22, 2023**

*   I'd like to go back to work. Hire me!
*   Reading _The Overstory_ by Richard Powers
*   Spending more time in the darkroom making silver gelatin prints
*   Re-doing my blog in Eleventy.

(Thanks to [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/) for the idea of [keeping a /now page](https://nownownow.com/about) like this one.)
